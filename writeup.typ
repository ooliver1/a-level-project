== Analysis

=== Problem Identification

In exam time, students can get stressed from revising for exams. Many students use video games as a way to escape from revision from time to time, but many games require too much of a time investment to be able to play for short periods of time. Multiplayer games can help during exam time as it can be a time to socialise during breaks while revising. Many recent games also require powerful computers to run the graphics requirements they meet, so I propose a game which has simpler graphics, shorter round times, and is multiplayer.

==== Clients
My users are a group of 15-19 year old students which sometimes play video games. Many of them prefer smaller games where you do not have to worry if you have time to finish the game/round. Many of them also have low powered laptops, so a game that is easier on the graphics is more enjoyable due to less lag.

=== Questionnaire

~~I have chosen to use a questionnaire with short answers to interview my clients. In this first questionnaire, I wanted to get a general idea of what is most important in this genre of game. I asked these questions:~~
sharp gave long answers yoo

1. Have you played a multiplayer arcade-style game before?
2. If so, how many different games in this genre have you played?
3. What were your favourite parts of these games?
4. What were your least favourite parts of these games?
5, What would you like to see in a game like this?

/*
Milan
1. Yes, I have.
2. Probably something around 20.
(I'd assume most of the discord activities count, and then there's some steam games like Golf With Your Friends, Ultimate Chicken Horse, etc.)
3. I particularly enjoy how these games facilitate a competitive environment while not being particularly frustrating to lose. Compared to real competitive games, it's easy to jump into a game like this with a group of friends and just have a good time trying to win, even if you end up doing poorly.
4. Generally, there's a very simple premise behind this type of game. After a couple hours of play it can feel like I've seen everything the game has to offer, which leads to me growing tired of such a game particularly quickly.
5. This mostly relates to my answer to (4.), where I think some extra thought into replayability can go a long way. Something like impactful powerups can drastically change the flow of a game, which can go a long way towards keeping it interesting.

(Another pretty cool example of this is Ultimate Chicken Horse (sick name), where the whole premise of the game is to have the players "create" the levels on the fly in a match. Each player gets to pick one of a few random items at the beginning of each round which they then place. Levels generally start off impossible to clear so players need to cooperate to make it winnable, and from there they start placing stuff to make it hard to clear. The goal of the game is to clear the stage while making others unable to clear it.)

Alex
1. Yes
2. Atleast 10 ðŸ¤·
3. Playing against/with friends --> competition / teamwork
4. When someone is a lot better than the rest of the group (skill gap)
5. Skill levelling (chess.com has this when playing with friends, making it harder for one of the players?
*/

/*
Gwen
1. yes
2. ~5
3. i like it when the rules are pretty simple but the game can be played in different ways  based on the player
4. i dont like it when seemingly benign aspects of a game (ie character selection or locations on a map) give a player an unfair advantage over their competitors
5. more collaboration between teammates

...
// Wow almost like I asked people that already play putt party

1. How would you like to control your ball?
2. How many holes would you like to play per game?
3. How long should the time limit be per hole?
4. What items would you like to see in the game?
5. What type of music would you like in the background?
6. How should you be able to join a multiplayer game with a friend?

==== Existing Solutions

// TODO: Evaluate how you can pair up in multiplayer modes (invite code, link, search)

===== ogcopen.com
#image("./images/ogcopen.png", height: 250pt)

`ogcopen.com` is an online 3D golf game. It has multiplayer with random people and groups.

This game has high-detail graphics to look similar to real golf, as well as complex controls for the ball such as intensity, accuracy and placement.

Unfortunately it does not seem to have settings for UI theme and does not seem to respect browser text size in some places. This makes it difficult to read for visually impaired people.

This game is a bit too complex for the style of game I am looking for. The controls are too hard to understand, and there are too many elements like equipment and training. I am going more for a crazy golf style game where anyone can get started with a shallow learning curve.

===== Backyard Mini Golf
#image("./images/backyard-mini-golf.png", height: 250pt)

`Backyard Mini Golf` is a 2D mini golf game. It is single-player only with levels.

Despite it not having multiplayer, the interface is similar to what I am looking for. Simple and easy to understand, no initial skill required. The text is large but not intrusive, and there are no complicated elements added.

One disadvantage is that you cannot rotate the camera around the ball, so you are stuck with a static orthogonal camera where you can only pan. The green/yellow colour scheme looks all "yellow" with protanopia and deuteranopia colour blindness.

==== Features of the Proposed Solution

// TODO:
// Main menu, scoreboard, time remaining, what controls (drag mouse, how to pan (mouse, keyboard option))

==== Limitations of the Proposed Solution

My game would require a Wi-Fi connection. It could use a LAN for local play, but not bluetooth. This is a limitation as school/college Wi-Fi can be unreliable or not accessible at times, and some students may not have access to Wi-Fi at home.

Some visual impairments may be a limitation too. As the game will be 3D, it may be difficult to interpret with a visual impairment. I will try to make the game as accessible as possible with changes such as high contrast, but it may not be possible to make it accessible for all visual impairments.

The game will be controlled with a keyboard and mouse. This is a limitation as some students may not have access to a mouse, or may not be able to use a mouse due to a physical impairment. This would not be something I can solve completely initially, but a low amount of keyboard inputs would mean they can be remapped to a controller or an accessible input device.
