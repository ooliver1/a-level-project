== Analysis

=== Problem Definition
In exam time, students can get stressed from revising for exams. Many students use video games as a way to escape from revision from time to time, but many games require too much of a time investment to be able to play for short periods of time. Multiplayer games can help during exam time as it can be a time to socialise while revising alone.

=== Clients
My users are a group of 15-19 year old students which sometimes play video games. Many of them prefer smaller games that do not require a big time investment. They also like to play multiplayer games that can have short rounds so they do not need to align schedules as much.
